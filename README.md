# Custodian Integration Tool

A proof-of-concept tool that automates the analysis of custodian integration patterns for a wealth tech platform.

## Project Overview

This tool allows technical users to streamline the initial integration process by:
- Automating documentation ingestion
- Managing schema definitions
- Creating mapping logic between custodian and destination data
- Storing and iterating on integration logic

## Key Features

- **Document Upload**: Support for PDF, CSV, JSON, XML, or other structured formats
- **Schema Management**: Define and version MongoDB schemas
- **Automated Mapping**: AI-assisted mapping between custodian and destination values
- **Integration Logic**: TypeScript-based integration logic with versioning
- **Testing Framework**: Test integration logic with sample data

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript, Express
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js and TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **File Storage**: Local storage (with option for S3)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

## Project Structure

The project follows a monorepo structure with three main packages:

- `client`: React frontend built with Next.js
- `server`: Node.js backend with Express and MongoDB
- `shared`: Common types and utilities shared between client and server

For a detailed overview of the project structure, see [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).

## Development Progress

We're following a structured build plan with small, manageable chunks of work. 

**Current progress is tracked in [BUILD_PLAN.md](./BUILD_PLAN.md)**

Each task in the build plan is marked with one of the following statuses:
- üîÑ Not Started
- ‚è≥ In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed
- üîç Needs Review

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm (v7 or later)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit as needed)
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

This will start both the client (on port 3000) and server (on port 5000) in development mode.

To run only the client:
```
npm run dev:client
```

To run only the server:
```
npm run dev:server
```
