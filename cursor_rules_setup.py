These rules apply to every task, no exceptions.

## Stay Focused on the Task
- Work **only** on the specific task at hand; do not go out of scope.

## Preserve Established Patterns
- Do not modify workflows, structures, or conventions unless absolutely necessary.

## Avoid Duplication
- Before writing new code, check for existing functions that accomplish the same goal.
- Identify and clean up redundant or duplicate code.

## Enforce Code Cleanliness
- Refactor bloated files and avoid functions longer than **300 lines**.
- Ensure modularity for maintainability.

## Commit & Document Work Often
- Make **incremental commits** with clear, structured commit messages.
- Keep local files organized to track project progress.

## Keep Solutions Simple
- Avoid over-engineering; prioritize clarity and efficiency.

These rules ensure every task is validated with proper testing.

## Plan Testing Before Development
- Define **unit tests** and **end-to-end tests** before coding.
- Identify edge cases, failure scenarios, and performance limits.

## Execute Tests to Prove Work is Complete
- Run all relevant tests before submitting a task.
- Ensure no regressions or breakages.

## Unit Testing Best Practices
- Cover core logic and edge cases.
- Use the right frameworks:
  - **Flask/Python:** `pytest`
  - **LWC:** Jest
  - **React Native:** React Testing Library + Jest

## End-to-End Testing Guidelines
- Test complete workflows for real-world validation.
- Automate tests using **Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright**.

## Maintain Test Quality
- Prioritize meaningful test cases over sheer quantity.
- Add new test cases for any discovered bugs.

## Every Project Must Have a GitHub Repository
- If no repository exists, create a **new public GitHub repo**.
- Store repository details in a **standardized location** for reference.

## Commit Often with Detailed Notes
- Use structured commit messages:
  - **Feature Addition:** `feat: Added [feature]`
  - **Bug Fix:** `fix: Resolved [issue]`
  - **Refactor:** `refactor: Improved [module]`

## Automate Repository Setup
- Initialize Git (`git init`) if needed.
- Add a **`.gitignore`** file.
- Push an initial commit with a **`README.md`**.

## Branching Best Practices
- Use **feature branches** for new work.
- Merge via **pull requests** (PRs), not direct commits.

- Plans should be **saved locally** and easily accessible by agents.
- Completed plans should be cataloged for reference.

## Break Plans Into Daily Goals
- Tasks should be **divided into actionable goals**.
- Reference previous work to ensure continuity.
