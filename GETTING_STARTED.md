# Getting Started

This document provides instructions for picking up the Custodian Integration Tool project and continuing development.

## Current Status

The project is in the initial setup phase. We have:

1. Created a structured build plan in `BUILD_PLAN.md`
2. Outlined the project structure in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
3. Set up the README with project overview

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are in Phase 1.1 of the build plan:

1. Initialize git repository
2. Set up Node.js project with TypeScript
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier
4. Create basic folder structure
5. Set up MongoDB connection module

## How to Continue Development

1. Check the current status in `BUILD_PLAN.md` to see which tasks are not started, in progress, or completed
2. Update the status of tasks as you work on them (üîÑ ‚Üí ‚è≥ ‚Üí ‚úÖ)
3. Focus on completing the current phase before moving to the next
4. Commit regularly with descriptive messages following the convention in the README

## Development Workflow

1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Initialize the git repository if not already done
   - Create .gitignore with appropriate rules
   - Set up the basic project structure as outlined in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

2. **Project Configuration**:
   - Create package.json for the root, client, and server
   - Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Set up environment variables

3. **Implementation**:
   - Follow the phase order in BUILD_PLAN.md
   - Update task status as you progress
   - Ensure each component is properly tested before moving on

## Important Considerations

1. **Code Structure**:
   - Maintain separation between client and server code
   - Use shared types where appropriate
   - Follow TypeScript best practices

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Install only necessary dependencies
   - Use compatible versions across packages
   - Document any specific version requirements

3. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for each component
   - Ensure tests are passing before marking tasks as complete

## Handoff Notes

When handing off to the next agent:
1. Update the BUILD_PLAN.md with your progress
2. Summarize what you accomplished and any challenges encountered
3. Suggest next steps based on the build plan
4. Note any deviations from the original plan or structure
